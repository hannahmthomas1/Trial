  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>This foundation was started for the sake of hikers and nature walkers everywhere. It was started in September in
    the year 2021. Due to the worldwide pandemic, I became very fond of my time spent outdoors, as well as my time
    alone. This foundation has the potential to help all nature-lovers learn to appreciate trees for the beauty they
    possess instead of being distracted by labels.</p>
